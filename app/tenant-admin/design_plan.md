# Tenant Admin: Design & Content Plan

## 1. Design Plan
- **Theme:** "Business Growth" - Action-oriented, vibrant, and intuitive.
- **Visuals:** White-label feel (uses Tenant's primary colors via branding settings).
- **Layout:** Standard dashboard layout with sidebar. Top bar includes tenant logo and quick-create event button.
- **Aesthetics:** Modern, rounded-xl cards, soft emerald gradients, and clear call-to-action buttons.

## 2. Page List
- **Dashboard (`/dashboard`):** Real-time sales stats, event shortcuts, and recent orders.
- **Events (`/events`):** CRUD interface for events, sessions, and ticket settings.
- **Orders (`/orders`):** Detailed list of sales, customer lookup, and refund actions.
- **Discounts (`/discounts`):** Management of promo codes and redemption tracking.
- **Staff Management (`/staff`):** Invite team members and assign roles.
- **Branding Settings (`/settings/branding`):** Upload logo, set brand colors, and configure subdomain.

## 3. Content Plan
- **Sales Charts:** Visual representation of ticket sales over time per event.
- **Event Editor:** Multi-step form for basic info, venue (Dhaka/Chittagong/etc.), ticket tiers (BDT prices), and sessions.
- **Staff Control:** Table showing name, role (TenantAdmin/staff), and last login.
- **Revenue Summary:** Breakdown of "Net Earnings", "Total Fees", and "Payout Status".
