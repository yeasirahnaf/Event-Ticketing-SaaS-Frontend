# Staff: Design & Content Plan

## 1. Design Plan
- **Theme:** "On-Site Operations" - Fast, mobile-first, and high-contrast for daylight usage.
- **Visuals:** Large touch-friendly buttons, high-contrast text for scanning, and instant feedback animations.
- **Layout:** Single-column mobile-focused view. Tabs for "Scanner", "Lookup", and "History".
- **Aesthetics:** Minimal distraction, bold colors for status (Green for Valid, Red for Invalid), and dark mode support for evening events.

## 2. Page List
- **Assigned Events (`/staff`):** List of events the staff is assigned to.
- **QR Scanner (`/staff/scanner`):** Camera interface for ticket check-ins.
- **Manual Lookup (`/staff/lookup`):** Search bar for attendee name/email filtering.
- **Check-in History (`/staff/history`):** Real-time log of the last 50 scans.

## 3. Content Plan
- **Scanner UI:** Overlays showing "Event Name", "Total Checked In", and "Remaining Candidates".
- **Scan Result:** Large icon indicating "SUCCESS" or "ALREADY SCANNED" with attendee name and seat label.
- **Lookup Card:** Quick view of order details, ticket status, and a "Force Check-in" button for staff.
- **Incident Logging:** Simple form to log issues like "Duplicate Ticket" or "Lost QR".
