# Base User: Design & Content Plan

## 1. Design Plan
- **Theme:** "Account Hub" - Simple, minimal, and focused on personal data.
- **Visuals:** Soft slate and blue tones, focused on text-based info and history.
- **Layout:** Mid-width centered layout for profile management.
- **Aesthetics:** Clean forms, rounded avatars, and clear data tables.

## 2. Page List
- **Profile Overview (`/user`):** Personal details and account settings.
- **Global Order History (`/user/orders`):** History of all purchases across the TicketBD platform.
- **Security (`/user/security`):** Password management and 2FA settings.

## 3. Content Plan
- **Personal Info:** Full Name, Email, Phone Number, and Region.
- **Orders List:** Table of `order_id`, `tenant_name`, `event_name`, `amount (BDT)`, and `date`.
- **Security Status:** Logs of last logins and account activity.
